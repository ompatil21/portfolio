## 🤖 Introduction

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

I use this site as a central hub to:

- present my **software engineering & full-stack projects**  
- highlight my experience with **Next.js, Python/Flask, AWS, and analytics**  
- give recruiters and collaborators a quick, clean overview of who I am and what I build.

The design is focused on being:

- **fast** (Next.js, image optimisation)  
- **interactive** (Framer Motion, smooth animations)  
- **developer-focused** (showcasing real projects, not just placeholders)
